Education Prepares You for the Future
 The future of the students and the country depends on how we are as students.  
Student life builds the foundation for our life.
If your foundation is strong, the building will be a strong one too. However, a weak foundation cannot make a building stand. In other words, student life helps us embrace human qualities.
